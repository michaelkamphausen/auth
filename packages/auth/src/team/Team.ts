   * A server is an always-on, always-connected device that is available to the team but does not

   * `188.26.221.135`).
   *
   * The expected usage is for the application to add a server or servers immediately after the team
   * is created. However, the application can add or remove servers at any time.
   *
   * Just before adding a server, the application should send it the latest graph and the team keys
   * (so it can decrypt the team graph). No invitation or authentication is necessary in this phase,
   * as a TLS connection to a trusted address is sufficient to ensure the security of that
   * connection. In response, the server should send back its public keys. This library is not
   * involved in that process.
   *
   * The application should then add the server to the team using `addServer`, passing in the
   * server's public keys. At that point the server will be able to authenticate with other devices
   * using the same protocol as for members.
   *
   * The only actions that a server can dispatch to the graph are `ADMIT_MEMBER` and `ADMIT_DEVICE`.
   * The server needs to be able to admit invited members and devices in order to support
   * star-shaped networks where every device connects to a server, rather than directly to each
   * other.)
